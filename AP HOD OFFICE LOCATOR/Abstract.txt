With the bifurcation of AP state, all the government departments are being relocated in and around AMARAVATHI with 
the radius of 70KM. Many of the offices are being temporarily located within 3-4 years expected to occupy permanent location.
 So public are unaware of office addresses and location. 

This project aims to develop an android application that gives information regarding the AP Govt Dept main office locations. 
It facilitates locating those offices with google locator. It gives the information about various department descriptions along with
 the respective URLs. 

As it is an application supported by many of smartphones the public can get instantaneous geo-information regarding all the 
AP HOD offices. The user can also give the feedback regarding any difficulty in locating any department HOD office and can 
get the help from the administrator of this application.
