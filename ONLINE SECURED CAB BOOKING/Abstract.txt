In day to day life people need to transport from one to another place for regular transportation they may use railway, 
bus and cabs, among them cabs are not secure because the traveller doesn’t have information about cab and cab driver etc. .., 
so cities like Delhi, Mumbai are providing the cab reservation through calls. As the increase in usage of smart phones the cab 
booking can be possible through Apps.
	Now a day the online cab hiring stick on to calling and intimating the address to cab driver but there is no security for
 the customers who are travelling in the cab. Traveller in the cab has no idea where he is and he can’t track his path. 
There is no information to his family members that he safely reached the destination or not. 
As a solution, MY CAB’s deals with the online cab registration as well as security, to provide security, supervisor monitors the 
company and user transportation. Details of the company and user are approved by the supervisor. Taxi- Company can register 
through the company’s register option to provide their services and full details about the cabs.
 Customer can register through the customer’s register option to access the services like selecting the cab company. Customer 
will be provided with the driver id which has to be verified with the driver’s id while taking the cab. User has an option to set 
an alarm to know his status. The time and distance between starting point and destination will be estimated by the app itself. 
When estimated time completes the alarm raise automatically. Status of the traveller will automatically send to the registered numbers.
