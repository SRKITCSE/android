In the smart phone era, there is a huge scope of storing data within the device itself. Despite of that, there are a few security 
related problems. Confidential details, personal files, documents etc are visible to all its users on just opening the phone. 
To overcome such problems, the new application that we are going to create, helps its user to hide the data in their mobile, 
without being noticed by others. This is done by creating a user interface which functions exactly like a clock. 
When the user gives a long press on the icon, it prompts the user to enter the password. After that, he can view the data by 
entering the password correctly. Authentication used in this application is enhanced very confidentially as this app prompts 
to enter the password only when user press on the clockicon.
