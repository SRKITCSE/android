This project presents the Attendance system through mobile devices, which is developed using MIT App Inventor. 
The application is installed in every facultyâ€™s mobile phones and can be used to take attendance and view attendance only in online mode.
In the attendance system through mobile devices, the Faculty marks and submit the attendance for any class of their choice.
This application stores the attendance in the public cloud and the Hod/Class-Teacher can view the attendance of their respective course whenever required. 
Such systems may be manual or automated.
Biometric-based system, card-based system are some of the examples of automated attendance system. 
In the manual attendance system, the faculty takes the attendance of the students enrolled in different courses taken by the faculty.
The information regarding the attendance is then passed on to the academic section of the institute where the information is feed into the institute server database.
